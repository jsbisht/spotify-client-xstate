# Model-Based Testing with `@xstate/test` and React Demo

This is a React project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It demonstrates how to use `@xstate/test` with React to automate the generation of integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests of an example application.
